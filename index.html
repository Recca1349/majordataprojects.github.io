									<h2><a href="#">Caf√© Harmony Sales Performance Analysis</a></h2>
									<p>This project focused on helping Caf√© Harmony, a fast-growing virtual caf√© chain, overcome operational challenges during its expansion phase. Using Excel, I cleaned, analyzed, and visualized datasets covering sales, customer demographics, inventory, employee performance, and customer feedback. Key insights revealed top-selling products, high-value customer segments, frequently understocked items, performance gaps among employees, and low customer satisfaction levels. Based on these findings, strategic recommendations were implemented, resulting in reduced stock shortages, improved staff performance, increased customer ratings, and higher revenue ‚Äî all within a 3-month post-implementation period. The final deliverable included an interactive Excel dashboard with key KPIs, pivot charts, and slicers to support ongoing decision-making.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Retail sales and customer behavior analysis using Excel dashboards</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/mart image.webp" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Frontier Mart, our client, approached us to help them gain clarity on their sales performance and customer behavior across their broad product offerings. Despite being a leading retailer in the consumer goods space, they struggled with understanding monthly sales trends, identifying top-performing products, and analyzing customer payment preferences.

Through detailed data analysis using Microsoft Excel, we uncovered several areas needing attention: unclear performance of product categories, inconsistent profit margins, and lack of insight into customer purchase methods. These discoveries enabled us to recommend focused strategies‚Äîsuch as promoting high-performing items, optimizing sales channels, and leveraging preferred payment modes‚Äîthat empowered Frontier Mart to drive more informed, data-backed decisions and enhance their overall business performance.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Improving Operational Efficiency and Patient Experience Through Data-Driven Insights</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/hospital image2.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Sterling Heights Hospital, a mid-sized healthcare facility, was experiencing challenges in delivering efficient, patient-centered care. Issues such as prolonged patient wait times, uneven doctor workloads, and limited visibility into treatment trends were affecting their performance and patient satisfaction.

To address these challenges, I independently developed and deployed an interactive dashboard using Microsoft Power BI. I analyzed patient visit data, treatment categories, admission trends, and doctor availability, and visualized key metrics to support real-time decision-making.

The dashboard enabled hospital management to monitor performance indicators, allocate resources more effectively, and respond quickly to operational bottlenecks.

Within just 4 months of implementation, the hospital recorded:

‚è±Ô∏è 30% reduction in average patient wait times

üòä 18% increase in overall patient satisfaction scores

üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è 25% improvement in doctor workload distribution

üìä Significant boost in data-driven decision-making across departments

This project is a strong demonstration of my ability to transform raw data into actionable insights using Microsoft Power BI. It highlights my skills in data analysis, visualization, and storytelling to drive measurable impact in a real-world healthcare environment.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Optimizing Pharma Sales and Customer Insights with Power BI</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pharmacy image.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>NovaMed Solutions, a major pharmaceutical distributor, faced key challenges in managing product performance, customer engagement, and regional sales visibility. Despite operating in a competitive healthcare supply chain, the company lacked clarity on top-selling drugs, underperforming segments, and customer behavior trends across countries.

To bridge this gap, I independently developed and deployed a suite of interactive dashboards using Microsoft Power BI, transforming raw sales and demographic data into strategic insights.

Using detailed sales transaction data, I analyzed revenue trends, profit margins, drug rankings, customer demographics, and country-level contributions. The dashboards provided business leaders with a clear, visual understanding of where to focus efforts‚Äîwhether that meant optimizing inventory, targeting high-value customers, or expanding in revenue-rich regions.

Within just 4 months of implementation, NovaMed achieved a 19% increase in revenue from top 5 drugs, led by Doxycycline, targeted expansion in Canada and Australia‚Äîthe highest-grossing countries, improved marketing personalization based on insights from age and gender demographics, inventory waste reduction by identifying consistently underperforming products, and greater strategic alignment driven by transparent, data-backed reporting.

This project showcases my ability to turn data into business value through storytelling, dashboard design, and analytical rigor. It demonstrates my strength in building end-to-end BI solutions‚Äîfrom data modeling and DAX to visual storytelling‚Äîwith Microsoft Power BI as the core tool.</p>
